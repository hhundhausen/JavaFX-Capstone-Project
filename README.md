## JavaFX Capstone Project 
---
**Project Motivation** 

- While completing dual enrollment in high school, I enrolled in the CS 112 Introduction to Computer Science II: Java at MiraCosta Community College; I was assigned this capstone project to complete. 

- Moreover, the project required conceptualizing, designing, and developing a GUI (graphical user interface) application to solve a current issue.

**Project Objective** 

- My parents and I moved more than ten times during my childhood, from across the world to down the street. Throughout my moving experiences, I have witnessed many situations arise from landlords and property management companies. As I grew older, I realized this was an experience many other families and individuals faced; these concerns needed to be shared.  

- Thus, to solve this issue, I developed a GUI application using the capstone project assigned to me to give people a voice and reduce the stress of renting. The application allows users to review and rate the services of prior landlords or property management businesses, based on addresses, for future prospective occupants.
